# About Bankie.go

Bankie.go is a Golang Fintech App I am Building as a side hobby.  It is very different from the stocks trading app I am creating in my other account - gadaUp - which is a stock trading fintech solution based on the Naive Bayes algorithm.

This project makes use of PostgreSQL and GORM plugins.
